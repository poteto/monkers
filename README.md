# monkers 🐒 + 🦀
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/poteto/monkers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/poteto/monkers)

Short for `monkey-rs`. An implementation of [monkeylang](https://monkeylang.org/). Previously, I implemented the interpreter in [TypeScript](https://github.com/poteto/boba-js). I am re-implementing the interpreter and later compiler in Rust as a learning exercise.
